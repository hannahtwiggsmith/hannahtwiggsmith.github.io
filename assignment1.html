            <h2>Moomin Cookie Cutters</h2>
            <p>
            1. First, I searched online to find moomintroll images that would work as cutters. I decided on creating a full moomin cutter, a moomin head cutter, and a groke cutter. Here are the images I found:
            </p>
            <img src="A1/source_images/moomin.png" width=400></a>
            <img src="A1/source_images/moomin1.jpg" width=400></a>
            <img src="A1/source_images/groke.jpg" width=330></a>
            <p>
            2. For each image, I used Illustrator's image trace feature to convert the image to a line drawing. Using a line drawing allows me to have simple paths to work with, rather than filled shapes.
            </p>
            <p>
            3. I edited the line drawing by removing control points. I added two layers, one for internal features and one for the external contour. As you can see in the image below, I colored the internal features red so I could easily see them.
            </p>
            <img src="A1/svg/cutter_moomin.svg" width=400></a>
            <img src="A1/svg/cutter_moomin_head.svg" width=400></a>
            <img src="A1/svg/cutter_groke.svg" width=330></a>
            <p>
            4. I exported the <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/branchwelder.github.io/tree/master/A1/illustrator">illustrator files</a> as SVGs, and imported them into Rhino.
            </p>
            <p>
            5. In order to create the walls of the cutters, I needed to give the paths a thickness. I did this by creating an offset path for each curve that makes up the SVG.
            </p>
            <p>
            6. I extruded the paths according to whether they were internal or external features. I extruded the external wall 0.5 inches and internal features 0.3 inches. Ideally, I would 3D print one with these distances and modify them as needed to get well-defined internal features.
            </p>
            <p>
            7. Finally, I added a raft to the whole cutter to support the wall features. I did this by creating an offset of the external wall and extruding the curve 0.1 inches.
            </p>
            <p>
            8. Done! Export as an STL. (Rhino files <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/branchwelder.github.io/tree/master/A1/rhino">here</a>, STLs <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/branchwelder.github.io/tree/master/A1/stl">here</a>) The final Groke cutter is below. I'd like to try this out on some cookie dough. I might need to add holes for air to escape while the cutter is cutting. I also might need to play around with the wall thicknesses to get ones that make sense for my print settings and the properties of cookie dough.
