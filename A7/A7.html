            <h2 class="title">Final Project Proposal: Sci-fi/Fantasy Catan</h2>

            <p> My final project will be a sci-fi themed Settlers of Catan board game that I am naming Settlers of (Something TBD). I am inspired by this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2525047">magnetic and multicolored</a> Catan-style game I found on thingiverse (shown below). This game is really cool, but I want to make my own that is 1) cast in resin and 2) themed with things I like.</p>
            <div style="margin: auto"><img style="width:100%" src="pics/catan.jpg"></a></div>

            <p>Traditional Settlers of Catan has five types of resource tiles: Stone, Brick, Wood, Wheat, and Sheep. Additionally, there are ocean tiles and a central desert tile. I am going to replace these with various references to science fiction literature. I have not decided on all of them, but I want the desert tile to be a "Dune" reference, with the normal sandstorm on top of it replaced with one of the giant sand worms from Dune.</p>

            <p>Here is a list of the base game's board pieces with a first-pass at my ideas for a sci-fi/fantasy theme.</p>

            <p>I realize that this might be a bit ambitious for two weeks. I am breaking this process down into steps:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>CAD pieces in Rhino</li>
              <li>Convert Pieces to one-part molds</li>
              <li>3D print each mold</li>
              <li>Cast silicone in the molds</li>
              <li>Develop the resin color scheme by trying some different color mixtures</li>
              <li>Cast resin</li>
              <li>Design resource and development cards</li>
              <li>Plot resource and development cards on cardstock</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These molds will be one piece molds. I intend to purposely design them with few, if any, overhangs, to allow for easy removal of the game pieces.</p>
