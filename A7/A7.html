            <h2 class="title">Final Project Proposal: Sci-fi Catan</h2>

            <p> My final project will be a sci-fi themed Settlers of Catan board game that I am naming Settlers of . I am inspired by this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2525047">magnetic and multicolored</a> Catan-style game I found on thingiverse (shown below). This game is really cool, but I want to make my own that is 1) cast in resin and 2) sci-fi themed.</p>
            <img style="width:50%" src="pics/catan.jpg"></a>

            <p>Traditional Settlers of Catan has five types of resource tiles: Stone, Brick, Wood, Wheat, and Sheep. Additionally, there are ocean tiles and a central desert tile. I am going to replace these with various references to science fiction literature. I have not decided on all of them, but I want the desert tile to be a "Dune" reference, with the normal sandstorm on top of it replaced with one of the giant sand worms from Dune.</p>

            <p>Here is a list of the base game's board pieces with a first-pass at my ideas for a sci-fi theme.</p>

            <p>I realize that this might be a bit ambitious for two weeks. I am breaking this process down into steps:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Mofr l</li>
              <li>Tea</li>
              <li>Milk</li>
            </ul>

            These molds will be one piece molds. I intend to purposely design them with few, if any, overhangs, to allow for easy removal of the game pieces.
