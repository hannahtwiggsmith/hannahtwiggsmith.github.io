            <p>
            I created a mold and casts of Kaonashi, "No-face", from the Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away. I think Kaonashi is a very recognizable character and would make a good mold due to being smooth without many fine features. I 3D-printed a mold for the mold, cast silicone into it, and then cast plaster into the silicone mold. I also used acrylic paints to paint one of the final models.
            </p>
            <p>I found a mesh that I liked of Kaonashi <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3734383">on Thingiverse</a>. I tried a few different methods for creating the 3D model of the mold, but I eventually found  <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printing-for-Two-Part-Silicone-Molds/">an instructable</a> published by McNeal/Rhino on using Rhino for two-part molds which was very instructive!
            I tried using the mesh from thingiverse for a while, but kept running into problems so I decided to CAD my own Kaonashi model. It turned out to be a pretty simple model, with just a few lofts. I traced the face from a still of Kaonashi from the film and subtracted the details from the model. That left me with this model:</p>

            <p>I extracted a silhouette of the model and created a parting surface by doint a 2-rail sweep along the silhouette. I also added keys and a pour spout to the model:</p>

            <p>I copied the model, raised the sides, and boolean differenced/unioned everything together.</p>

            <p>Now, I had my two mold halves ready to export and slice in Cura. I sliced this one at relatively low settings because it was going to take a long time to print and I was planning on sanding the final model. I also wanted to use this as a test run to get the process down - I have another model of the companion cube from portal that I'm going to make at a much higher quality next.</p>

            <p>I printed the mold in 3D Solutech Denim PLA. Each half took about seven hours.</p>

            <p>Next step: Oomoo! I mixed it well, using a kitchen scale to measure it 1:1 by weight. I slooowwwwly poured it into the mold, starting with the lowest areas. I poured in a very thin stream to avoid bubbles as much as possible. Once I finished pouring the silicone, I dropped each m old half on the table a number of times to dislodge as many of the air bubbles as possible.</p>

            <p> I was happy with how the silicone mold turned out. I didn't have any bubbles, but the low reseolution I printed at was definitely apparent</p>

            <p>Now was time to cast. I mixed my plaster and poured it into the mold, again very slowly. Before I closed the mold up, I started by pouring the plaster into the face area so I could be sure that the plaster reached all of the little details. I could only find one rubber band for my mold, so I also used some masking tape.</p>

            <p>After about 30 minutes, I de-molded the figure. It was still warm from the exothermic plaster, but it turned out great!</p>

            <p>I like the plaster look, but I wanted to paint one of the models. I sanded it outside with 90 and 150 grit sandpaper to smooth out the layer lines from the 3d printing process, and painted it with acrylic paint.</p>

            <p>Tada!</p>

            <p>I woke up this morning with him staring at me. It was a little offputting</p>
