            <p>One of my favorite video games is Hollow Knight. I found a thing on thingiverse that features a multiple-part STL for the two main characters. Given that I already own multiple stickers, lapel pins, and T-shirts with the Knight and Hornet on them, I naturally need to also have a cast resin model for them. My plan is to create these two models using multiple two-part and single-part molds out of resin that is colored with alcohol inks and mica powders. I'm going to start with Hornet because I like her more.<p>

            <h3>Colors and Such</h3>
            <p>I want to get the colors of the model right, so I will also create a mold that I will use for experimenting with the inks and powders. This doesn't need to be anything fancy, but I would like it to be at least a little bit functional. Therefore I am making a mold that is a bunch of individual consruction kit pieces that can be assembled into some sort of structure.</p>
